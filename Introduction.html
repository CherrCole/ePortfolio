			<p><b>Newly acquired skills</b></p>
			<p>I acquired a new skill to develop a reflective portfolio that goes beyond a mere collection of work,
				allowing me to showcase introspection, self-evaluation, and growth.
				In addition, I manage to hone my skill to construct well-structured and comprehensive mind maps. This

				issues and opportunities from a different and new viewpoint. I have a sharp analytical mind that allows
				me to analyse material objectively, assess its reliability, and discover underlying assumptions and
				prejudices.
				Furthermore, my creative thinking skills enable me to generate innovative ideas and explore
				unconventional approaches to problem-solving. I embrace ambiguity and uncertainty, viewing them as
				opportunities for new insights and breakthroughs. I excel at making connections between seemingly
				unrelated concepts, thinking outside the box, and embracing experimentation to arrive at novel
				solutions.
				I am confident in my ability to combine critical and creative thinking in a harmonious manner. This
				capacity allows me to approach complex tasks and projects with a holistic mindset, considering multiple
				perspectives and leveraging diverse ideas to drive innovation and create positive outcomes.
