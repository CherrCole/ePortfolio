	<button class="accordion"><b>What difficulties did I face with the research process?</b></button>
	<div class="panel">
	<br>
	<p><b>i. Limited Availability of Resources</b></p>
	<p>The first challenge I faced was the limited availability of relevant and reliable sources of information. I realized the importance of conducting a comprehensive literature review to identify gaps and determine the most credible sources. I meet my challenge by expanding my search strategies, exploring various databases, and reaching out to experts in the field to access relevant and reliable information.</p>
	<p><b>ii. Managing and Organizing Large Volumes of Data</b></p>
	<p>I have difficulties managing and organizing large volumes of research data, but I understood the significance of effective data management and organization for efficient analysis and retrieval. Hence, I employed research management tools and developed a systematic approach to categorize, store, and analyze data, ensuring easy access and efficient handling of the large dataset.</p>
	<p><b>iii. Defining Clear Research Objectives</b></p>
	<p>The next challenge that I faced was the difficulty in narrowing down the research focus and defining clear research objectives. I learned the importance of clearly defining research objectives and narrowing down the focus to ensure a cohesive and meaningful study and conducted extensive background research, sought feedback from mentors, and refined my research questions to establish a clear direction for my study.</p>
	<p><b>iv. Time Constraints</b></p>
	<p>In addition to that, I faced time constraints and balancing research with other responsibilities. I recognized the significance of effective time management and prioritization to meet research deadlines while balancing other commitments, so I created a research schedule, set realistic goals, and allocated dedicated time for different research tasks, ensuring a balance between research and other responsibilities.</p>
	</div>
	
	<button class="accordion"><b>What major lessons did I learn about the research process? How did I meet the challenges?</b></button>
	<div class="panel">
	<br>
	<p>I discovered the importance of investing time in comprehending complex concepts and methodologies to ensure accurate interpretation and application when dealing with complex or technical concepts that require deeper understanding. Hence, I engaged in extensive reading, attended seminars and workshops, and sought guidance from experts in the field to deepen my understanding and grasp complex concepts effectively.</p>
	<p>I understood the significance of rigor and transparency in research to ensure the validity and reliability of findings to ensure the validity and accuracy of research findings. So, I implemented robust research methodologies, collected data meticulously, maintained detailed documentation, and conducted a thorough analysis to enhance the credibility of my research.</p>
	</div>
	
	<button class="accordion"><b>When working with outside evidence, what kinds of steps do you take to prevent plagiarism?</b></button>
	<div class="panel">
	<br>
	<p>Preventing plagiarism is essential for maintaining academic integrity and ensuring that research is based on original work. Hence these are the few steps that I have taken to prevent plagiarism.</p>
	<p><b>i. Familiarize with Various Form of Plagiarism</b></p>
	<p>As I understood what constitutes plagiarism, I familiarize myself with the various forms of plagiarism, which includes avoiding direct copying without proper citation, paraphrasing without attribution, and self-plagiarism. Next, I planned my research and writing process, which can prevent unintentional plagiarism by creating a research plan that includes identifying my research goals, gathering relevant sources, and keeping track of all the sources consulted. When I want to incorporate ideas or information from a source into my own writing, I practice effective paraphrasing and summarizing techniques by expressing the ideas in my own words.</p>
	<p><b>i. Familiarize with Various Form of Plagiarism</b></p>
	<p>I am aware to use proper citation and referencing especially when using ideas, information, or direct quotes from a source, and then cite and reference it properly. I also ensure to follow the appropriate citation style guidelines to ensure consistency and accuracy in my citations and to include in-text citations within my writing and to provide a comprehensive reference list or bibliography at the end of my work. For additional measures, I utilized a plagiarism detection tool to check my work for any instances of unintentional plagiarism. These tools have helped to compare my writing to a vast database of published works and identify any similarities that may indicate plagiarism, and after reviewing these results, I make the necessary revisions to avoid plagiarism.</p>
	<p><b>iii. Seeking Guidance</b></p>
	<p>As the final measure, I seek guidance and ask for help especially when unsure about proper citation practices or need assistance with paraphrasing or summarizing, consult writing guides, style manuals, or academic writing resources. I have reached out to third parties to further clarify on plagiarism prevention.</p>
